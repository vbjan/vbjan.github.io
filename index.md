# About Me

Hi I'm Jan. I believe in the beauty ðŸŒŸ and power ðŸ’ª of mathematics. By teaming up with like-minded people ðŸ‘¥, I love to translate math into code ðŸ’» to find intelligent solutions for real world problems.

This mission led me to study Data Science for my Master's at ETH and Harvard, which I finished at the end of 2023.

During two research projects at these institutions, I worked on problems in computer vision and scientific computing:

- ðŸŒŠ Throughout my 9-month full-time research stay with [Petros Koumoutsakos](https://seas.harvard.edu/person/petros-koumoutsakos) at Harvard, I tackled the problem of data-driven turbulence models in computational fluid dynamics. To that end, I developed a new method to learn such a turbulence model using reinforcement learning. The resulting paper is currently under review. You can find the preprint here [[Link]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00972).

- ðŸŒ³ During my 3-month research project at [Stefano Mintchev](https://usys.ethz.ch/personen/profil.MjczNjI4.TGlzdC8yODUyLDMyMDE5NzIyMg==.html)'s lab at ETH, I worked on depth estimation solutions to infer occluded tree branches from RGB-D imagery. The resulting paper is accepted in IEEE RA-L [[Link]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10403997).

Currently, I am actively seeking a PhD position and am particularly excited about representation learning and scientific ML.

If this text resonates with you, feel free to reach out. I love meeting new people. You can reach me at
