# About Me

Hi I'm Jan. I believe in the beauty ðŸŒŸ and power ðŸ’ª of mathematics. By teaming up with like-minded people ðŸ‘¥, I love to translate math into code ðŸ’» to find intelligent solutions ðŸ’¡ for real world problems.

This mission led me to study Data Science for my Master's at ETH and Harvard, which I finished at the end of 2023.

During two research projects at ETH and Harvard, I designed AI systems to tackle unsolved problems in computer vision and scientific computing:

- ðŸŒŠ Throughout my 9-month full-time research stay at Harvard, I tackled the problem of data-driven turbulence models in computational fluid dynamics. To that end, I developed a new method to learn such a turbulence model using reinforcement learning. The resulting paper is currently under review. You can find the preprint here [[Link]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00972).

- ðŸŒ³ During my 3-month research project at ETH, I worked on depth estimation solutions to infer occluded tree branches from RGB-D imagery. The resulting paper is accepted in IEEE RA-L [[Link]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10403997).

Currently, I am actively seeking roles as a Machine Learning Engineer or Data Scientist, where I can apply my technical expertise in ML to develop innovative solutions alongside a team of similarly passionate colleagues.
