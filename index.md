# About Me

Hi I'm Jan. I believe in the beauty ðŸŒŸ and power ðŸ’ª of mathematics. By teaming up with like-minded people ðŸ‘¥, I love to translate math into code ðŸ’» to find intelligent solutions for real world problems.

This mission led me to study Data Science for my Master's at ETH.

During research projects at ETH and Harvard, I worked on problems in computer vision and scientific computing:

- ðŸŒŠ Throughout my 9-month full-time research stay with Petros Koumoutsakos at Harvard, I tackled the problem of data-driven turbulence models in computational fluid dynamics. To that end, I developed a new method to learn such a turbulence model using reinforcement learning. The resulting paper was published at the ICML 2024 AI4Science workshop.

- ðŸŒ³ During my 3-month research project at Stefano Mintchev's lab at ETH, I worked on depth estimation solutions to infer occluded tree branches from RGB-D imagery. The resulting paper was published in IEEE RA-L.

If this text resonates with you, feel free to reach out. I love meeting new people. You can reach me at vbjan[at]ethz[dot]ch.
