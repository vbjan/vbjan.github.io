# Welcome to my Website!

As a Data Science master student at ETH Zurich with a background in Mechanical Engineering I completed a range of courses in the fields of Mathematics, Engineering and Computer Science. I was additionally responsible for teaching the subjects Linear Algebra I & II, Deformable Body Mechanics and CAD & Technical Drawing both online and in person as a Teaching Assistant at ETH.

During my studies I discovered my passion for Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, which I find Data Science to be a beautiful combination of.

This website is a presentation/collection of my projects that I engage in to further my education in Mathematics and Computer Science. It furthermore acts as a project itself and as a place to collect resources for my students. Please open it on a desktop or tablet.
