# About Me

Hi, I am a [Data Science Masters student at ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch/studies/master/master-ds.html) and am currently writing my Master's thesis at Harvard SEAS. I am particularly interested in the field of artificial intelligence. To that end, I am also very intrigued by the more vague and philosophical questions of what sets human intelligence as a very general kind apart.

During my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at ETH, I discovered my passion for applied mathematics and computer science, which I find AI and data science to be a beautiful combination of.

This website is a presentation/collection of my projects that I engage in to further my education in Mathematics and computer science. It further acts as a project itself and as a place to collect resources for my students.
